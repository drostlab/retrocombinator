#' retrocombinator: Simulating The Evolution of Retrotransposons Over Time
#'
#' This software package performs simulations on retrotransposon sequences over
#' long periods of time (~500M years). It takes into account bursts and
#' recombination events. Furthermore, it has functions to perform basic data
#' analysis on the simulation results.
